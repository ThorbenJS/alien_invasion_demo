# "Alien Invasion" demo
This is my first proper attempt at object oriented programming with Python. It is my take at making a game that is more or less like the classic Alien Invasion.

To run the game, run the "alien_invasion.py"- file. May require some library imports.

This project was meant to just get a better grip on Python and OOP.
The game has a basic scoring system, levels with increasing difficulty, working movement, hitboxes, damage and health logic, working enemies and proper collision logic.
Every element of the game is made with pure Python.
